<h1>Core Java</h1>
<p>Java is a general-purpose programming language. Much of the syntax is derrived from C & C++ but Java has fewer low-level dependencies than those other<br/>
    languages. For example, in C++ it's not uncommon for the programmer to have to manage memory usage. Java handles this automatically.<br/><br/>
    Java is an object-oriented programming language. Java programs are compiled to bytecode which can run on any Java virtual machine, JVM.<br/>
    Java aims to allow the programmer to write once, run anywhere. In theory you should be able to run the same Java program on a linux machine as a Windows machine.<br/>
    This is mostly true but some implementation details hamper this goal. Java was developed in the early 1990's at Sun Microsystems by James Gosling.<br/><br/>
    Sun has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation so they now maintain Java.<br/><br/>
    Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use today.<br/><br/>

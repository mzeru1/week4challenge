<h1>Classes and Objects</h1>
<h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
<p>First there was functional or top-down programming. All programs had a single entry point and worked their way down, line by line, to a single exit point.<br/>
    They could jump around with various routines and go-to statements but all code was basically one large file. And it got cumbersome.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Division of labor</h3>
<p>
    Somehow the idea emerged that you could have a programmer develop code in units or blocks or what is now known as "classes". And these classes could be developed<br/>
    simultaneously and put together in a larger program. And re-used in other programs. And also tested independently. Once tested, they wouldn't have to be tested again.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>What goes into a class?</h3>
<p>
    Each class should have one purpose. Maybe you need a Calendar class to display calendars and perform date arithmetic. Or an Invoice class to display/print an invoice<br/>
    and perform all the calculations. Or an Encryption class which can take some text or a file and return an encrypted version of each. Each class can be used to create objects.<br/>
    These will contain the data and any processing methods to fulfill the purpose of the class.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Differences between classes and objects</h3>
<p>
    The class is the code that will be executed, the type of data to be saved and the way it interacts with other things. The object is a particular instance of the class.<br/>

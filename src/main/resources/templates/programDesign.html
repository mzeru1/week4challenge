<h1>PROGRAM DESIGN</h1>
<p1>"The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build." â€”Fred Brooks<br/>
</p1>
<p1>When writing a program you need to begin with a solid understanding of the problem you intend to solve.<br/>
    Then, move on to understanding the data you will be using in your solution. Your program will use data in variables,<br/>
    constants and literals. Your program will also contain data structures, files and data validation.<br/>
</p1>
<h2>
    Overview: Developing software solutions
</h2>
<p1>Requirements and design phase:</p1>
<ul>
    <li>Define the problem to be solved.</li>
    <li>Outline your solution on paper.</li>
    <li>Develop the outline into an algorithm.</li>
    <li>Test the algorithm for correctness.</li>
    <li>Document your solution.</li>
</ul>
<p1>Implementation and verification phase:</p1>
<ul>
    <li>Code the algorithm into a specific programming language.</li>
    <li>Run the program on the computer.</li>
    <li>Test your program, make corrections.</li>
    <li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p1>Maintenance phase:</p1>
<ul>
    <li>Document and maintain the program.</li>
</ul>
